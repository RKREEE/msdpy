# Project msd.py
This is the offical Mobile Speedrunning Discord bot.

To get started make a file called `config.json` and add your bot token
```json
{
    "token": "YOUR TOKEN HERE",
    "blacklist": [],
    "nasa_apikey": "NASA API KEY HERE (https://api.nasa.gov)('DEMO_KEY' has a lower limit, but can be used)"
}
```
After that install dependencies with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
